Running Gaussian Average
mu_t =  alpha * I_t + (1-alpha)*mu_(t-1)
sigma_t^2 = d^2*alpha + (1-alpha)sigma_(t-1)^2
if |I_t - mu_t|/sigma_t > k ==> foreground
if |I_t - mu_t|/sigma_t<=k  ==> background

d = euclidean distance between mean and value = magnitude
where mu_t is average at t, alpha is weight, I_t is pixel current value
alpha = 0.01
k = 2.5
